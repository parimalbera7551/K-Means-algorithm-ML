# K-Means Clustering on Multi-Band Images
  # Overview
  This project demonstrates the application of K-means clustering on multi-band images. The images used in this project are 512x512 pixel grayscale images, and K-means clustering is applied to group the pixels into clusters based on their intensities.
  # Objective
  The main objective is to use K-means clustering to segment multi-band images into different clusters. This helps in understanding how K-means clustering groups similar pixel intensities and provides insights into the image's structure.
